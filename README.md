I tried to make a non PiP scope mod.

Several scopes don't work, including high magnification ones.
I built in a toggle to disable the scopes with a magnification that's above ~9X

Readme is WIP

Things to do:

- Add a blacklist key and make it work properly
- Find a way to apply the lens shader to the reticle
- Explore multiple ways of seeing through the scope
- Allow users to set custom variables for LOD and farclip settings
- Make auto LOD and farclip be less intensive
- Fix variable scopes sticking when going past max/min zoom levels = Next step
- ~~Make the auto disable FOV limit configurable~~ = DONE
- Learn to actually code without being on AI life support
